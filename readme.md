# Shows I'll Never Finish

The general summary of my foundations capstone project is a site that holds a list of shows
That I haven't finished for many reasons but the main one being that bootcamp has drained all of my free time.

## Description

Features are
* quickfire series suggestion randomizer
* list of series and their current season, current episode and total episodes from a server side object
* progress that can be updated at the push of a button that propogates on the front end
